1. compile

Compile by typing "make" in the directory the Makefile is in. This will compile the client and server programs.

2. run

Run the commands as such, noting that X Y and Z are variable standins for an actual number. Type each command on a different host and in chronological order.

run "./server 0" on host dcX
run "./server 1" on host dcY
run "./server 2" on host dcZ
run "./client 0 dcX dcY dcZ" on another machine
run "./client 1 dcX dcY dcZ" on another machine
run "./client 2 dcX dcY dcZ" on another machine
run "./client 3 dcX dcY dcZ" on another machine
run "./client 4 dcX dcY dcZ" on another machine

After the last command is typed, you should see alot of output coming from each terminal. At the end, each file will be populated with numbers. They should be the same across directories.
